The data for this project is available at [nasawakeupcalls.data](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data).

### Search

A great way to search this dataset is to use the [CSV](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data/blob/master/nasawakeupcalls.csv)
search built-into Github.

### JSON

The [JSON](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data/blob/master/nasawakeupcalls.json)
output is used to build the site as well as output the CSV.

### Contibuting

I want to get as much of the original publication's data back into the JSON
output. I would also like the text to be edited more consistently.

Where there are gaps in the dataset, or inconsistencies, it would be great to
see people fill those in. I would love to improve the accuracy of the data
about songs and artists where it can be done.

### Creating

It would be awesome to see folk build on this work and create something cool.
Please feel free to share and I will create a space on this blog to promote
it to its audience.

*Happy hacking!*
