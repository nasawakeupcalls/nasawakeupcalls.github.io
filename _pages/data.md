The data for this project is available at [nasawakeupcalls.data][data-1].

[data-1]: https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data

### CSV

One way to explore this dataset is to use the [CSV][data-2] search mechanism
built-into Github.

[data-2]: https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data/blob/master/nasawakeupcalls.csv

### JSON

The [JSON][data-3] output is used to build the site as well as output the CSV.

### Contibuting

It would be great to:

* Get as much of the original publication's data back into the JSON output.
* Edit the text, specifically comments, more consistently.
* Create a resources page to share other NASA playlists
* Reduce the gaps in the dataset where songs or artists are missing.
* Reduce inconsistencies, e.g. where different university fight songs have been
referenced in text, provide a complete song-name and context.
* Develop some archiving practices around the NASA websites that still exist,
for example there is a lot of mutimedia out there from the missions themselves,
e.g. [STS-108][data-4]

### Creating

It would be awesome to see people build on this work and create something cool.
Please feel free to share and I will create a space on this blog to promote
it to its audience.

*Happy hacking!*
