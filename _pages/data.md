The data for this project is available at [nasawakeupcalls.data](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data).

### Search

A great way to search this dataset is to use the [CSV](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data/blob/master/nasawakeupcalls.csv)
search mechanism built-into Github.

### JSON

The [JSON](https://github.com/nasawakeupcalls/nasawakeupcalls.data/blob/master/nasawakeupcalls.json)
output is used to build the site as well as output the CSV.

### Contibuting

It would be great to:

* Get as much of the original publication's data back into the JSON output.
* Edit the text, specifically comments, more consistently.
* Create a resources page to share other NASA playlists
* Reduce the gaps in the dataset where songs or artists are missing.
* Reduce inconsistencies, e.g. where different university fight songs have been
referenced in text, provide a complete song-name and context.
* Develop some archiving practices around the NASA websites that still exist,
for example there is a lot of mutimedia out there from the missions themselves,
e.g. [STS-108](https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/audio/shuttle/sts-108/html/ndxpage1.html)

### Creating

It would be awesome to see people build on this work and create something cool.
Please feel free to share and I will create a space on this blog to promote
it to its audience.

*Happy hacking!*
