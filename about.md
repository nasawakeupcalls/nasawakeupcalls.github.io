I don't remember how I discovered the original
[NASA Wake Up calls](https://web.archive.org/web/20170724074739/https://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf)
history compiled by Colin Fries in the NASA history division. But! I did know
the wake-uo call was a 'thing'.

A memory of a movie set in space maybe? Someone famous singing to a crew bound
to go into history... a Bruce Willis type? Sandra Bullock? Tom Hanks?
The singer/songwriter on the ground someone equally famous: a Beatle? A Rolling
Stone? A Beyonce? It may just have been something I read in the
[Right Stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(book)) once.

The surprise to me was finding this record. A history, incomplete, yet so
comprehensive, more so than anything out there that we could possibly imagine.

The history, to my eyes, is lovingly put together. It covers as many missions
and programs as information could be gleamed for. Those who want to play along
at home can find NASA's links to mission pages, or video of that
[streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfGLEjsWZd0) at the time. The
chronology discusses the first ever song that could be found
[Hello Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7N2wssse14). And goes right up
to Paul McCartney playing live for 14 minutes for the crew of
[STS-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-121); and beyond into the cold
Martian mornings where the tradition continued for the Spirit and Opportunity
Rovers.

The only thing is, all of this rich history, and its beautiful narrative was
locked up. Locked up in a PDF file. I know there's a version out there on the
NASA servers written in Word 2013 but it's not 'data'. Data that is easy to
update might be a **+1** for the NASA history division). Data that is easy to
remix is a **+1** for all of y'all out there looking at this site and its
links and imagining the possibilities of doing cool things  with it.

As a fan of music, a digital preservation expert, an MA in digital humanities
and a fan of Space, and NASA, I fell in love with this small 89-page document
the moment I saw it.

I have turned it into data in the hope that y'all can turn it into something
more, or even, just to unlock more gems of information from it than maybe
currently possible. I have found so many lovely gems of information while
producing this 'data-edit'.

How many times was Bruce Springsteen or Talking Heads played out there in
outer-space? What was the last piece of music played on the last Apollo
mission? Was the [Reveille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_peXjzFQ2_c) bugle
call the most played song in the last 54 years?

Most importantly! (to me!) What do all of these songs sound like played
back-to-back? (I am working on that!)

I also turned it into data so that maybe even [NASA](https://github.com/nasa)
can pick this up and make it even more complete one-day, with even more
missions.

Thank you *NASA*. Thank you so much **Colin Fries**. Please enjoy the output of
a this remix.

# Introduction, by Colin Fries

*(From the original 89 page history [CHRONOLOGY OF WAKEUP CALLS (2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170724074739/https://history.nasa.gov)*

The idea for the Wakeup Call chronology arose as a result of my dual interests
in the history of music and the space program.
I discovered as soon as I began working as an archivist at the NASA History
Office that there was no complete list of these calls sent from Mission
Control.
There have always been inquiries about flown items and mission events as we all
know, and those about wakeup calls and music played in space encompassed a
steady stream (no pun intended)!
And NASA’s Web pages did provide audio for these calls beginning with STS-85
with the note that: “Wakeup calls are a longstanding tradition of the NASA
program” -- yet nothing on when it started.
One of the most frequent inquiries was and still is – What was the first wakeup
call?
(I later learned that it was "Hello Dolly" sent during Gemini 6).
So with the blessing of the history staff I began compiling a chronology using
the sources in the NASA Historical Reference Collection here at NASA
Headquarters.
The Space Shuttle portion of the Chronology proved to be the most challenging
since the Johnson Space Center Audio Control Room Recorder Log began with
STS-80.
In 2005, I was able to visit JSC Public Affairs and make copies from their
query books to fill in the gap.
Still there were Space Shuttle wakeup calls, even entire missions, that
remained elusive.
The other sources that I used are listed at the end of this PDF.
Please excuse omissions, incorrect dates, or even totally wrong entries due to
the patchwork nature of the data that I drew from.
We welcome input to improve the accuracy of the list.
We just ask that you provide a verifiable source.
The excerpts that immediately follow were chosen as excellent explanations for
the rationale that led to the tradition.
Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet it is on hiatus but it may be
revived when NASA's Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle is operational, or when
commercial craft are flying on a regular basis.

## Appropriate to the occasion...

Use of music to awaken astronauts on space missions dates back at least to
the Apollo Program, when astronauts returning from the Moon were serenaded by
their colleagues in mission control with lyrics from popular songs that seemed
appropriate to the occasion...Several crews have awakened on their final day in
space to Dean Martin’s popular song "Going Back to Houston."

The common element of all these selections is that they promote a sense of
camaraderie and esprit de corps among the astronauts and ground support
personnel. That, in fact, is the sole reason for having wake-up music; and it
is the reason that NASA management has neither attempted to dictate its content
nor allowed outside interests to influence the process.

Congressional Relations to Congressman Robert H. Michel - *January 9, 1990*

### CAPCOM vs. Manilow...

Aboard the space shuttle Discovery, astronaut Steve Robinson once used a
50-foot Japanese robotic arm to snare a four-ton satellite. But Robinson's
greatest professional challenge came on the ground. Last June, while working at
mission control, he was charged with playing wake-up music for another shuttle
crew. One astronaut's wife made him promise to play Barry Manilow's schmaltzy
ballad "A Little Traveling Music, Please," and Robinson's flight director --
the mission control center's big boss -- insisted he play the rousing U.S. Air
Force theme instead. A delicate decision.

*"So I played 'em back-to-back. I thought they would cancel each other out,"*
says Robinson tactfully. *"The only complaints were from the navy guys on the
crew. But I'm not sure if they were complaining about the air force song or
Barry Manilow."* Think of the space shuttle as a high-tech road trip with a
difference: You can't get out until the trip is over, pot and beer are
forbidden, and 125 miles straight down, somebody who isn't even traveling with
you gets to pick what's on the tape deck. That's often Chris Hadfield, chief
mission control CAPCOM (capsule communicator), who oversees little details like
wake-up music, which is broadcast on an intercom-type system with small
speakers on the upper and lower decks of the shuttle.

*"You play some lively, peppy bit of music -- normally just two minutes of it
-- and after a pause, you hear some groggy voice on the microphone mumbling,
'Good morning, Houston,'"* Hadfield explains. *"You don't want to play a dirge
or something uninspiring. You want to get them going in the morning."*
Consequently, the selections are usually benign -- it's considered poor form,
and possibly dangerous, to freak out a sleeping astronaut with Rob Zombie or
Eminem. But the DJs at mission control have been known to exhibit a mischievous
streak. Once, to the crew's sleepy confusion, Hadfield chose the booming
half-U2 version of the Mission: Impossible theme. The 1965 Gemini VI mission
was one of the first to include onboard music. Those brave astronauts got
**"Hello, Dolly!,"** as sung by clean-cut crooner Jack Jones. For the Apollo II
moon mission, flight director Eugene F. Kranz psyched himself up with John
Philip Sousa marches. In 1972, the Apollo 17 crew heard the Carpenters' "We've
Only Just Begun." The cheese subsided somewhat with the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project, the first U.S.-Soviet manned space flight: That crew woke to the
strains of Jerry Jeff Walker's "Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother." Since
then, more anthemic fare has prevailed: the theme from Rocky (1984), "Bohemian
Rhapsody" (1989), and the Star Wars theme (1993). The '93 Columbia shuttle
mission had better luck with hip reveilles including the Thompson Twins'
"Doctor! Doctor!" and R.E.M. 's "Shiny Happy People." (It would be a
different playlist if DJs did a set at mission control. Moby told Details he
would play the Clash's six-gunning version of "I Fought the Law," and a
little Bach or Hendrix. Master mixologist Armand Van Helden would spin Steve
Miller's "Fly Like an Eagle" [what, no "Space Cowboy"?] and David Bowie's
"Space Oddity." Mr. Space Oddity himself would choose Steve Reich's "Music
for 18 Musicians.")

Because in space no one can hear you scream, *"Turn that Crap down!,"* personal
CD players and headphones help fly guys maintain their sanity.

For his space-shuttle mission last year -- the one with Senator John Glenn,
who preselected Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" as the wake-up
call -- astronaut Steve Robinson brought 20 discs. While riding an exercise
bike on the lower level, Robinson listened to electric-blues guitarists Albert
King and Stevie Ray Vaughan. While staring literally into space, he chose a
musician friend's version of Pachelbel's Canon. He fell asleep to Chris Isaak.
*"It's one of the most personal things that you're able to take up in space.
Wherever your music is, that's sort of a version of home,"* says Robinson. Both
Robinson and Hadfield belong to a 12-year-old, all-astronaut, Houston-based
rock 'n' roll quartet known as Max-Q, whose rotating members cover bash-it-out
standards like "Louie Louie." Named after an aerodynamics term for "maximum
dynamic pressure," the band has yet to release any albums but occasionally
plays NASA functions. In 1993, they woke up the Discovery crew with a cover of
"Heartbreak Hotel."

Such musical experience comes in handy in space -- especially if you believe in
cross-cultural exchanges. Four years ago, preparing for a shuttle mission to
the Mir space station, Hadfield knew he would encounter Thomas Reiter, a German
astronaut and accomplished classical guitarist. He also knew earlier Mir
astronauts had left a beat-up acoustic for future crews -- which, he surmised,
Reiter wouldn't appreciate. So Hadfield had a company modify an electric
guitar, making it lighter than usual and foldable to fit his luggage. United on
Mir, 250 miles above the Earth, Hadfield and Reiter sang Beatles songs and
Russian folk ballads. Air guitar, says Hadfield, was never quite like this:
*"It's great floating weightless going around the world, playing guitar."*

On the way back from Mir, Hadfield set his CD player for the Celtic weeper
"Danny Boy," his favorite song ever, and watched the stars go by. The
experience gave "Headphone music" a whole new meaning. *"There are certain
stanzas of music, certain harmonies, certain lyrics, which sometimes just send
a warm rush up your backbone,"* Hadfield says. *"And you get that almost
continuously up there."* And to think that we here down on Earth thought Barry
Manilow couldn't possibly sound any better.
