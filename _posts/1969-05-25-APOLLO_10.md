âœ« Come Fly With Me by Unidentified  &nbsp;<br />
âŠ¹ Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah by Unidentified

#### Comment:
* Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah was sent from mission control to the crew, but only after the crew themselves, awake before mission control's first transmission, sent 'Come Fly with Me'. The following message attached: "Good morning, good morning! This is Tom, John, and Gene from KAT 10, broadcasting again from approximately 140,000 miles [259,280 km] out into the universe. Itâ€™s a beautiful day out here, and it appears that it might be a beautiful day down in Mother Earth country. For those of you who are not just ready for work or are just getting up: Get up lazy bones! It's time you got up! Big day ahead! And the thought for today is: Remember, National Secretaryâ€™s Week was last month!"
