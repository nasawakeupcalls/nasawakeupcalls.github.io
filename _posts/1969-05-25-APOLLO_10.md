#### Comment:
* "This - This is just so that you guys don't get too excited about the TV and forget what your job is down there". Sent from the crew to mission control: 027:22:27 Cernan: If people want to know what kind of men go to the Moon, there's a good look at one right there. Could you believe it? 027:22:35 Stafford: Some people still don't. 027:22:52 McCandless: I'm surprised you all have not set this to music. 027:22:58 Cernan: Oh, you want music, Well, we'll give you some music at the conclusion here. 027:23:10 Stafford: Okay. We'll take you back outside now. 027:23:14 McCandless: Roger. 027:23:28 Cernan: While Tom shows you that, we've got another little rendition we'd like to put your way. 027:23:33 McCandless: Roger. We're standing by. 027:23:54 Cernan: Here it comes. This - This is just so that you guys don't get too excited about the TV and forget what your job is down there. 027:24:05 McCandless: We're ready for what we're about to receive. 027:24:07 Unidentified Crew member: [Music being played.] 027:24:36 Cernan: We don't need it all. 027:25:16 Stafford: Just wanted to send some thoughts back to you. 027:25:18 McCandless: Roger. Thank you for your thoughts, and with this view of the Earth, it looks like the United States - The landmass of the U.S. is showing up better now than it was few minutes ago.
