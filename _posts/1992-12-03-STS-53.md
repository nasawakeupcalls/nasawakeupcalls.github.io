Jingle Bells by the Singing Dogs

##### Comment:
* The astronauts, who nicknamed themselves the dogs of war because their flight supposedly is the last shuttle mission devoted to Defense Department work, were roused by a canine rendition of Jingle Bells. Crew dogs, wake up. We got work to do, Mission Control's Carl Meade said. Good morning, Carl. Dogs of war are wide awake, commander David Walker replied.
