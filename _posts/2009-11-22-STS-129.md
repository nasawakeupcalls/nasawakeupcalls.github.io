âœ¦ Butterfly Kisses by Bob Carlisle

##### Comment:
* was played for Mission Specialist Randy Bresnik. Responding to the wake-up call from Houston, he delivered the news that his wife Rebecca had given birth, saying good morning, Houston. Good morning, Rebecca, good morning, Wyatt, and good morning to our little girl. I just wanted to take this opportunity to report some good news, he said later in the morning. At 11:04 last night, Abigail Bresnik joined the NASA family and momma and baby are doing very well. I'm very thankful for everyone ... that's been so supportive and so helpful the last couple of days with everything that's been going on. The shuttle crew's wakeup music, chosen by Bresnik's wife, was a song titled Butterfly Kisses, which starts off with the lyrics: There's two things I know for sure: She was sent here from heaven and she's daddy's little girl.
