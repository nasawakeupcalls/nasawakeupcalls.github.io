#### Comment:
* The song was played for Commander Mark Kelly. Wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords helped start the first full work day in space for her husband and the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour with the song. It's the same song Giffords sent as a wake-up call to Mark Kelly in 2006 when they were just dating. But this time the message-of-hope lyrics seemed to have a special meaning given her recovery from being shot in the head Jan. 8 in Arizona. This time the song was from Giffords and Kelly's two daughters. It's good to be waking up in space again, Kelly radioed back to Earth. I want to thank Gabby, Claudia and Claire for that great wake up song. It's always good to hear U2 and 'Beautiful Day' in space.
