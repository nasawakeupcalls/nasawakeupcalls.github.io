âœ· Silver Inches *by* Enya    &nbsp;<br />
âœ· Shalom Lach Eretz Nehederet *by* Yehoram Gaon  

#### Comment:
* Dedicated to Dave Brown. PC
Dedicated to Ilan Ramon - The tune is the same as Arlo Guthrie's City of New Orleans. Ilan said, Good morning, Stephanie, it was wonderful to hear your voice in Hebrew. It was perfect timing while we flew over Israel to hear this song, which says I've been to the North Pole and to everywhere but there's no place better than Israel. PC

#### *Dedication:*
> *On lift-off, Space Shuttle Columbia, the first of the fleet to reach space in the 80's suffered damage to its left-wing. We would not learn that this damage was catastrophic until re-entry into the earth's atmosphere on February 1 2003. Space-shuttle Columbia suffered systemic failures throughout its descent before mission control finally lost contact with flight-commander Rick Husband and crew. Space Shuttle Columbia broke-apart over Texas in the early hours of the morning. Its crew would not return.*
