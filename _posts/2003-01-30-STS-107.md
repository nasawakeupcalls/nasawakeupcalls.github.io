Dedicated to Ilan Ramon - The tune is the same as Arlo Guthrie's City of New Orleans. Ilan said, Good morning, Stephanie, it was wonderful to hear your voice in Hebrew. It was perfect timing while we flew over Israel to hear this song, which says I've been to the North Pole and to everywhere but there's no place better than Israel. PC
