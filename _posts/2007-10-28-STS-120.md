âœ¦ What a Wonderful World, by Louis Armstrong

#### Comment:
* was played for Mission Specialist Scott Parazynski on the day he makes his second spacewalk of the mission. That's how you start the day in space, Parazynski said. I can't think of a more beautiful way to begin the day than hear those words. It really describes the view from space.
