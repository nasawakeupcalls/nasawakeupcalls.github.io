✵ Boatswain's Call by Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass  &nbsp;<br />✧ Lonely Bull by Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass

#### Comment:
* The boatswain's pipe was directed to Pete Conrad by Paul Hand, probably because Conrad was Navy. You should have started doing that on about day 2, Conrad quipped. And the crew down here couldn't find a song for three bulls, it was only one, replied CAPCOM. Conrad countered with, Here's a little old song, love. And then PAO filled in the background: That last song coming down from Skylab was out of Pete Conrad's repertoire of country-western music he has aboard. From Mission Commentary SL-II MC-1305/2.
