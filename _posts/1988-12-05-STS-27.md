✷ Star Wars (Main Title) by John Williams  &nbsp;<br />✧ Do You Want to Know a Secret? by The Beatles

##### Comment:
* Using Star Wars theme music as background, Darth Vader's voice awoke the crew with a message followed by satirical lyrics sung to The Beatles tune, Do You Want to Know a Secret? The recording was produced by Houston radio station KKBQ's Mike Cahill, Pat Brennan, and Mark Richardson.
