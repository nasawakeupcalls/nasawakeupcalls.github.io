‚äπ Con Te Partiro by Andrea Bocelli

##### Comment:
* An Italian song that translates to I will go with you. The song was performed by Andrea Bocelli and played for French astronaut Leopold Eyharts. I'd like to see everybody back on Earth, Eyharts told flight controllers. Thanks a lot for the music and see you very soon.
