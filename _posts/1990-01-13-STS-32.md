Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (Theme) by John DeBello
Notre Dame Victory March by JSC Mission Operations Directorate personnel

##### Comment:
* The astronauts took time out for a little fun Saturday afternoon, playing the song Attack of the Killer Tomatoes from the movie of the same name as they showed Mission Control a drawing of LDEF wildly entwined in tomato vines. It referred to the student  (SEEDS) experiment, sending 12.5 million tomato seeds into orbit aboard LDEF.
Notre Dame Victory March for pilot Jim Wetherbee, graduate of Notre Dame. Sung by quartet of JSC Mission Operations Directorate personnel, all Notre Dame graduates (Lead: Mark Ferring, class of '80. Tenor: Chris McKenna, class of '84. Baritone: Pete Hasbrook, class of '85. Bass: Fisher Reynolds, class of '82) That was provided by local alumni of a school you know pretty well, said Mission Control's Ken Bowersox. Yeah, there's a lot of  Damers down there, said Wetherbee, a 1974 graduate of the school in aerospace engineering.
