âœµ Celebration by Kool and the Gang

#### Comment:
* played for Mission Specialist Sandy Magnus. The song was accompanied by a special good morning message recorded by employees at NASA's Stennis Space Center in southern Mississippi, the NASA center that is home to the test stands that verified each of the main engines that helped propel space shuttles into low Earth orbit, including the three used in the STS-135 launch. Good morning Atlantis, from your friends at Stennis Space Center, Stennis employees said. It's time to fire up your engines - laissez les bons temps rouler! Laissez les bons temps rouler, is a Cajun French phrase that translates Let the good times roll. was in good working order before it was installed.
