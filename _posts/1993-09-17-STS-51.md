âœ§ Theme for the Common Man by UNKNOWN

##### Comment:
* Videotape views of Earth with Theme for the Common Man by crew beat Mission Control's wakeup call by five minutes. We didn't mean to preempt your music, just precede it, Discovery commander Frank Culbertson Jr. told Mission Control's Susan Helms. Of course the videotape views of the Earth are just on the flight day highlights. On the shuttle they just hear the music. PC
