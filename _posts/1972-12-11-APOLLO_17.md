âœ« City of  New Orleans by John Denver

##### Comment:
* (Good Morning, America line in song refers to Command Module, America. The wake-up call for landing day was John Denver's version of the Steve Goodman  song, The City of New Orleans, with its chorus of Good morning, America, how are ya? It was a happy song that had been suggested by people on the night shift in the press room - a song that matched the mood of the crew and, indeed, country-music-fan Schmitt requested a replay while he and the others finished waking up.
