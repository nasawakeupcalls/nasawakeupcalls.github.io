Imagine by John Lennon<br />Yaar ko hamne ja ba ja dekha by Abita Parveen

##### Comment:
* McCool and Ramon said their observations from orbit reveal no borders on the Earth below and reiterated in both English and Hebrew their hopes for peace in the world. Dedicated to Willie McCool. PC. Imagine was played at Ilan Ramon's funeral as his funeral dirge. The mourners listened to the recording sent to the astronauts, which ended with Ilan's voice translating Lennon's words into Hebrew: You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
Dedicated to Kalpana Chawla. A videotape of the crew activities during this wakeup call survived the accident. PC
