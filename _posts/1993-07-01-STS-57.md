âœº I'll Be Home For Christmas by Bing Crosby

##### Comment:
* The mission was extended twice to wait for acceptable landing weather in Florida. On July 1st if the weather was acceptable it would land in Florida, otherwise it would be sent to California. So it wasn't a question of whether they would land that day but where. Of course after that many delays the crew may have wondered when they would finally make it home... Capcom Susan Helms played I'll Be Home For Christmas. Given that it was July 1st they presumably did make it home in time. PC
