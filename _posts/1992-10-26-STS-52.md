âœ¦ The World is Waiting for the Sunrise by Les Paul and Mary Ford

##### Comment:
* written by Gene Lockhart and performed by Les Paul and Mary Ford. His daughter June -- who needs no introduction, I'm sure -- is in the (Mission Control) viewing room this morning and sends her best wishes, Mission Control said. Well, great. Thanks a lot. We'll have to see if we can learn that song shuttle commander James Wetherbee replied. June Lockhart was one of the stars of the TV show, Lost in Space.
