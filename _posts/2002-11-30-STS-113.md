âœ¦ Walkin' on Sunshine by Kylie Minogue

#### Comment:
* Selected by Paul Lockhart's daughters. Capcom Joan Higgenbotham radioed up the music and said Good morning Endeavour. Welcome to EVA (Spacewalk) 3 day. We're looking forward to some more incredible views provided courtesy of our two spacewalkers. Paco (Lockhart's nickname), this morning's wakeup music is 'Walking on Sunshine' which is what Mary and the girls will be doing once your safely back home. Good morning Miss Joanie and to everyone down there in mission control. It's great to hear your voice this morning, Lockhart replied. Walking on sunshine? I think that's what John (Herrington) and Mike (Lopez-Alegria) are going to be doing for several hours today...  I'd like to say thank you to my wife and my daughters for thinking about me the last few days and I'm looking forward to seeing them too. PC
