âœ« The Presence of the Lord, by Byron Cage

#### Comment:
* The crews of Discovery and the International Space Station were awakened before the change from daylight to standard time. The crew was roused at 1:08 a.m. CDT with the song The Presence of the Lord, written by gospel musician Kurt Carr, originally recorded by Byron Cage. Cage's rendition was played for Mission Specialist Stephanie Wilson. Crew member Stephanie Wilson says she appreciates the selection. She says being in space has made her very thankful for the support of family, friends and the shuttle ground control team.
