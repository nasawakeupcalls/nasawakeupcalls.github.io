âœ¦ The Final Frontier (Theme from Mad About You) by Paul Reiser, Don Was

##### Comment:
* The team sent their wakeup call to Mars as a joke (it's not like a spacecraft would need music) and the team enjoyed it enough that it became a tradition. The Mad About You production office was surprised by the choice and put out a press release noting the unusual use for their theme song. They even used a clip of the Mars team playing the music in the end credits of one of their shows. PC
