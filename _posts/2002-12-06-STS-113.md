⊹ I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher  &nbsp;<br />
✷ Jeopardy Theme by UNKNOWN

#### Comment:
* Clips from the movie Groundhog Day (I Got You Babe) and the television game show Jeopardy The Groundhog Day was a reference to the multiple landing attempts. At this point STS-113 tied the previous record of two additional extensions waiting for good weather. With the additional day beyond that, they set a new record for the number of landing tries. The Jeopardy theme music was a running gag between Mike Lopez-Alegria and the Capcoms where he would pose various questions about the mission's status as quizzes. At one point the Capcom answered one of L-A's queries, and he replied But you forgot to phrase it in the form of a question. The evening before when MCC said goodnight a Capcom cautioned the wakeup music may sound familiar. Wetherbee replied How will we know? (a reference to the repeating cycle in the movie Groundhog Day. PC
