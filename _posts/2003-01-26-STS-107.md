✵ When Day is Done by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli.  &nbsp;<br />
✦ Love of My Life by Queen

#### Comment:
* Dedicated to Dave Brown. Capcom Charlie Hobaugh said, We're doing great down here, and I feel cultured. Dave replied, It's about time. PC
Dedicated to Ilan Ramon. A videotape of the wakeup activities survived the accident. PC. A special good morning to my wife, Rona, the love of my life, Ramon said. In Hebrew, he added that he loved and missed his wife and children. So, here we come, for a wonderful day in space.

#### *Dedication:*
> *On lift-off, Space Shuttle Columbia, the first of the fleet to reach space in the 80's suffered damage to its left-wing. We would not learn that this damage was catastrophic until re-entry into the earth's atmosphere on February 1 2003. Space-shuttle Columbia suffered systemic failures throughout its descent before mission control finally lost contact with flight-commander Rick Husband and crew. Space Shuttle Columbia broke-apart over Texas in the early hours of the morning. Its crew would not return.*
