##### Comment:
* Dedicated to Dave Brown. Capcom Charlie Hobaugh said, We're doing great down here, and I feel cultured. Dave replied, It's about time. PC
Dedicated to Ilan Ramon. A videotape of the wakeup activities survived the accident. PC. A special good morning to my wife, Rona, the love of my life, Ramon said. In Hebrew, he added that he loved and missed his wife and children. So, here we come, for a wonderful day in space.
