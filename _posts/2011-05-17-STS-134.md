‚äπ Drops of Jupiter by Train

#### Comment:
* played for Pilot Greg Johnson, a tune selected for Johnson by his family and radioed up to the shuttle by Mission Control. I love that song and I love being in space, Johnson radioed Mission Control. Johnson thanked his teenage son Matt for choosing the song and apologized for missing his birthday, which is tomorrow. And I want to say that's a perfect way to start an exciting rendezvous day!
