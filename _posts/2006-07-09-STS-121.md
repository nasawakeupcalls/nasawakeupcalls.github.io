#### Comment:
* for Shuttle Pilot Mark Kelly. Requested by his daughters, Claire and Claudia. Mark had a dream as a young boy-- he wanted to go to space and float with the stars. So, on the sixth day of the mission, he was coaxed from his sleeping bag on the ceiling by the music of ABBA. He responded by saying: Sometimes it is like a dream up here. Floating is a big part of that. The view outside the window is incredible right now. I'm not sure what we're over, but we can see land down there.
