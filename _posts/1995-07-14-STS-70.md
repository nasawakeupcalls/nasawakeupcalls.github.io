##### Comment:
* The crew of STS-70 was awakened shortly after three this morning Central time to the theme from 'Woody Woodpecker,' a cartoon character adopted as the mascot for the mission when real woodpeckers plucked holes in protective insulation on Discovery's external fuel tank last month causing a delay in the mission.
