âœº Window on the World by Jimmy Buffett

#### Comment:
* played for Mission Specialist Kathryn Hire. That song is very appropriate today, said Endeavour mission specialist Kay Hire. On a day that we'll be working on opening our new window on the world. Our wakeup music today on Endeavour was Jimmy Buffett's 'Window on the World,' astronaut Steve Robinson observed. I think that came from Kay's family. Ah, lovely, Patrick replied.
