âœ· Slowness by Calexico

#### Comment:
* was played for Kelly. Mark Kelly picked Calexico's Slowness as a wake-up call to honor his wife, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and her hometown, Tucson. Kelly tells mission control in Houston that Gabby really wants to get back there and is really looking forward to that, so it's an appropriate song. That's coming soon.
