âœ· Amarillo .by. Morning by George Strait

##### Comment:
* Expedition 11 crew of Commander Sergei Krikalev and Flight Engineer and NASA ISS Science Officer John Phillips, woke up 30 minutes later. Amarillo By Morning was dedicated not to the crew in space, but to the Columbia STS-107 crew commanded by Amarillo Native Rick Husband. The day included a dedication to the Columbia crew and other space explorers who died during their missions. When the wakeup was sent it was Husband's son, Matthew's birthday. PC
