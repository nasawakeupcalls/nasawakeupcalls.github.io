Man on the Moon by R.E.M.

##### Comment:
* Michael Stipe front man for R.E.M. started  the crew's day with an A capella version of the group's hit, Man on the Moon. On recording this song for the Atlantis' last crew Stipe said, I recorded 'Man on The Moon' for NASA in Venice, Italy, where Galileo first presented to the Venetian government his eight-power telescope, and in 1610 wrote 'The Starry Messenger' (Sidereus Nuncius), an account of his early astronomical discoveries that altered forever our view of our place in the universe. Good morning, Atlantis, he said. This is Michael Stipe from R.E.M. We wish you much success on your mission, and thank all the women and men at NASA who have worked on shuttle for three decades. From Earth, a very good morning to you.
