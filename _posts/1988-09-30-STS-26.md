âœ« Green Acres by Mike Cahill

##### Comment:
* Robin Williams opened with  Gooooooood Morning Discovery!!! in Good Morning Vietnam style. The original recording produced by Houston area DJ from KKBQ, Mike Cahill, also included original lyrics recorded to the theme music of the TV show Green Acres. Robin Williams was approached by Cahill about doing the tape. NASA knew nothing of the tape until it was offered as a gift by Cahill.
