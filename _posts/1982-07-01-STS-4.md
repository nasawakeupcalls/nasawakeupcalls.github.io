#### Comment:
* The astronauts got a wake-up call at 1:10 a.m. today from Houston control as the ship was passing over the Dakar, Senegal, tracking station. Columbia was making its 59th orbit at the time. There was no response at first from the crewmen, but mission control reported that engineering data showed the pilots were operating their food warmer for breakfast. Mattingly finally responded with a cheerful, Good morning.
