I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher

##### Comment:
* from the Groundhog Day movie soundtrack. Groundhog Day's I Got You Babe is a recurring theme for wakeup calls on missions which have been extended an additional two days, with the astronauts having to repeat their deorbit activities each day only to be told that because of bad weather they're going to go through the same tasks again the next day. For commander Ken Cockrell this was his third mission in a row where he's stayed in orbit for an additional two days in the hopes of good weather in Florida. On STS-80 the landing finally cooperated and he landed in Florida, for STS-98 and STS-111 he landed at the alternate site in California. PC
