âœ¦ Happy Birthday Tracy, by children at the Beaumont Cherry Valley Recreation and Park District's Noble Creek Community Center

##### Comment:
* The children were in an extended day care program run by Tracy Caldwell's mother, Mary Ellen Caldwell. In recognition of the day's significance. Thank you very much. This is one of the best places I could think of to spend my birthday, Tracy said after hearing the pre-recorded greeting.
