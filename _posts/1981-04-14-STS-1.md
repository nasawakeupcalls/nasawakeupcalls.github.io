âœ· Reveille (Bugle Call) *by* None  

#### Comment:
* Short excerpt from an old Spike Jones record followed by a comic tape with voices of Houston DJs Hudson and Harrigan kidding Young and Crippen, then  Reveille. It's splashdown, and Crip, you could both use a shower, said one member of the radio team. You've waited for this for 12 years and if you don't wake up you're going to miss the whole darn thing. Crip, said one voice, get out of the rack. No, no, no, said the other. If he wakes up he'll spill coffee all over the controls. Get to work, you guys. You've got 300 government agencies out there to support. Then Mission Control came back on the line. Now hear this, now hear this, reveille, reveille, up all idlers. And that last wakeup call, we'd like you to scratch out 'splashdown' and insert 'touchdown,' said Mission Control.
