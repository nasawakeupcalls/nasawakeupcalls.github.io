âœ· Centerfield by John Fogerty

##### Comment:
* was played for Pilot Ken Ham. Mission Control here roused the astronauts early Wednesday with the song Centerfield by John Fogerty, a tune selected for Ham by his wife Michelle. Girl, you are my home, and all of us are going to start our journey home today, Ham told his wife via Mission Control as the shuttle and space station zipped around the planet at 17,500 mph (28,163 kph). From my rough calculations, that's about a million miles, but we're going really fast so we're on our way.
