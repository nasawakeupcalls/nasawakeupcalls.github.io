‚äπ Aggie War Hymn by The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band

#### Comment:
* for Mission Specialist Mike Fossum, a graduate of Texas A&M University. According to Mission Control, the selection was sent by Fossum's wife. He is the first Texas A&M graduate in space. You know Mike, there are quite a few Aggies right here in Mission Control, and all throughout Texas, who have been watching you intently during this mission, said astronaut Steve Swanson from Mission Control in Houston. I think we can say the eyes of Texas are upon you.
