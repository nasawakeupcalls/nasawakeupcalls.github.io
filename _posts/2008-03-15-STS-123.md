âœº We're Going to be Friends by White Stripes

#### Comment:
* The song was played for Mission Specialist Robert L. Behnken. Thanks for that, Al, Robert Behnken replied. Good morning to you as well, and thanks for that great wakeup music, that's one of my favorite songs. It always reminds me of all the great friends that I've met going to different schools, or through different training, just like the shuttle crew I'm with right now. Thanks again, Al, and a great good morning to you. You bet. Have a fine day out there.
