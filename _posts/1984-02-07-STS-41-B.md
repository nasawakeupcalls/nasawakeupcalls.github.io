âœ« Armed forces medley by United States Air Force Academy Chorale

#### Comment:
* which covered three of the services. The Marine Corp., of course is Vance Brand's alma mater. He's now a civilian but was originally trained as a Marine Corps pilot. The Navy hymn in honor of Mission Specialist, Bruce McCandless and Challenger Pilot, Hoot Gibson, both Naval Officers. And the Army song honoring the nation's first United States Army Astronaut, Bob Stewart. And the music was performed by guess who, the U.S. Air Force Academy Chorale. From STS-41-B AIR/GROUND TRANSCRIPT
