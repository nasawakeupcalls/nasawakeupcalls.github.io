Walk of Life by Dire Straits

##### Comment:
* for Steve Robinson. The Space Station crew was awakened at 10:39 p.m. CDT by a tone onboard. CAPsule COMmunicator (CAPCOM) Shannon Lucid radioed the crew with Dire Straits' Walk of Life, in honor of the duo's upcoming repair work on the International Space Station. What a great day to go do a walk of life, said Robinson, who happens to play guitar in the astronaut rock band, Max Q. I like that line in there: 'You got the action, and you got the motion.'
