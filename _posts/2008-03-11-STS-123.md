##### Comment:
* The song, which is from the album Charlie Brown Christmas was played for Mission Specialist Mike Foreman. Good morning, Endeavour. And a special good morning to you, Mike, astronaut Al Drew radioed from the Johnson Space Center. Well good morning, Houston, we appreciate that song, Foreman replied. We had an exciting trip to orbit yesterday morning and we're looking forward to our first full day in orbit.
