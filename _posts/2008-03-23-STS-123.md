* The song was played for Mission Specialist Mike Foreman and performed by the Friendswood United Methodist Church Praise Team at his church. Good morning, Endeavour and Happy Easter to you Mike, NASA astronaut Alvin Drew radioed up from Mission Control. Good morning, Houston and thanks Alvin, that's one of my favorite songs from church, Foreman said. That was awesome, and how appropriate for this special day. It sounds just as good up here as it does down there. Happy Easter. Drew wished the rest of Endeavour's astronauts a Happy Easter as well, though they were busy at the time. They're probably searching for their eggs, Foreman said.
