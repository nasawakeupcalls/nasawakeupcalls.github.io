✷ Homeward Bound by Simon & Garfunkel  &nbsp;<br />
✦ What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong

#### Comment:
* Mission Control sent recordings of astronauts' children shouting such things as Get up, Dad, get out of bed and get to work and Hi, daddy, this is your darling daughter telling you to wake up. This was followed by What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong. The crew responded with Homeward Bound by Simon & Garfunkel
