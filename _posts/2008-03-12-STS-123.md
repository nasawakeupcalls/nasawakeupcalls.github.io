Fight scene music from Godzilla Versus Space Godzilla by Takayuki Hattori<br />Godzilla. by Blue Oyster Cult

##### Comment:
* The songs were played for Japanese Space Agency astronaut  Takao Doi. Good morning Endeavour. Doi san, ohayo gozaimasu, said Alvin Drew, shuttle spacecraft communicator, to Japanese astronaut Takao Doi from Mission Control here in Houston. Take on today like a monster. We are very happy to hear Godzilla, Doi responded. We are ready to go and we'll have a great time today docking with the space station.
