âœ· The Theme from Star Trek, performed by Alexander Courage

#### Comment:
* served as the wake up music for Discovery's crew at 2:23 a.m. It received the second most public votes from a Top 40 list in a Space Shuttle Program-sponsored song contest (671,134 votes (27 percent of the total). The top two songs with the most votes from that list earned the right to be played as wake up music for Discovery's crew during its final mission. As a bonus, actor William Shatner recorded a special introduction to the song: Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before. It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time. Discovery was the first space shuttle to dock to the International Space Station, during the STS-96 mission in 1999, marking just one time it did what no spacecraft had done before.
