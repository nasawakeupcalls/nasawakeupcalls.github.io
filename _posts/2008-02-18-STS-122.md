‚äπ Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World, by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole

#### Comment:
* The Hawaiian-Japanese vocalist was accompanied by his ukulele for crew member Dan Tani. The song was chosen for Tani by his wife Jane and their two young daughters, Keiko and Lilly. I can't wait to get back home, Tani said after hearing the tune. I've had such a wonderful time here, but it's time to get back to my family.
