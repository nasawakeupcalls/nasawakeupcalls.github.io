‚äπ Consider Yourself at Home. by UNKNOWN

#### Comment:
* The song, which is from the musical Oliver!, was played for Mission Specialist Stanley Love. That's a wonderful song, thanks so much for sending it, said Love, 42. He thanked his parents and family and people who may be feeling there's one fewer Love on Earth this Valentine's Day. But I'd like to assure them that it's great to be up here, and I'll be home soon.
