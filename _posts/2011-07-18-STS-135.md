* which was played for Mission Specialist Rex Walheim. The song was accompanied by a special good morning message recorded by employees at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. The NASA center is home not only to the astronaut corps, but also Mission Control and the Space Shuttle Program. Good morning, Atlantis, from all of us at the Johnson Space Center! chorused an auditorium-full of Johnson employees in a message recorded before Atlantis' launch. Have a great mission!
