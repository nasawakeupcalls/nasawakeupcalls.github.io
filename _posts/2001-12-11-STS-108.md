âœ§ Let There Be Peace on Earth by Vince and Jenny Gill

#### Comment:
* from the Vince Gill album Let There be Peace on Earth awakened Endeavour's crew this morning at 6:19 a.m. CST. The song was played for Expedition Three Commander Frank Culbertson from his wife for his years of dedicated pursuit of peace on Earth through service to his country, and in tribute to a special anniversary today.
