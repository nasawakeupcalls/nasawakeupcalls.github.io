✺ God Bless America by Kate Smith

#### Comment:
* Kate Smith's rendition of Irving Berlin's God Bless America woke Commander Chris Ferguson, Pilot Doug Hurley and Mission Specialists Sandy Magnus and Rex Walheim. But unlike most wakeup songs, which are played in honor of a particular crew member, this one was dedicated to all the men and women who have worked for the Space Shuttle Program in the past three decades... the men and women who put their heart and soul into the shuttle program for all these years, as Capcom Shannon Lucid told the crew. Ferguson said it was an appropriate song for their last day in space.
