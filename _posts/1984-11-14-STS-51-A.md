✫ For a Few Dollars More by Ennio Morricone  &nbsp;<br />
✷ Stars and Stripes Forever by n/a

#### Comment:
* Theme from the movie, For a Few Dollars More followed by Stars and Stripes Forever Bob Springer told the crew, It's a tribute to the day's activities. Springer referred to the fact that originally one group of insurance companies had agreed to pay NASA $4.8 million to retrieve only the Palapa payload. But two months ago, another group of underwriters signed up for the Westar salvage and NASA said it would do both jobs for a total of $5.5 million. Chicago Tribune 11/15/84
