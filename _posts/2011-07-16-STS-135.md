âœ§ Run the World (Girls) by Beyonce

#### Comment:
* After being awakened by a special greeting from songstress Beyonce Knowles. Beyonce also known as Sasha Fierce was born in Houston, also home of the final shuttle astronauts: Chris Ferguson, Doug Hurley, Sandy Magnus and Rex Walheim. Beyonce brought it on orbit when Girls was played for the entire crew as a tribute to the final shuttle mission and also to women in space: Good morning Atlantis, this is Beyonce. Sandy, Chris, Doug and Rex, you inspire all of us to dare to live our dreams, to know that we're smart enough and strong enough to achieve them. This song is especially for my girl, Sandy, and and all the women who've taken us to space with them and the girls who are our future explorers. http://www.archive.org/details/STS-134
