‚äπ Where My Heart Will Take Me by Russell Watson

##### Comment:
* the theme song from Star Trek: Enterprise. This song, was selected for the crew as a surprise dedication from the Deputy Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale. (This selection was identified as composed by Dennis McCarthy in STS-114 MCC Status Report #16. Though McCarthy did write the orchestral suites for the Star Trek TV series he did not write this. It was written by Diane Warren originally as Faith of the Heart for the soundtrack of the film, Patch Adams and sung by Rod Stewart. Then, virtually the identical song was renamed and used as the theme for Enterprise -- this time sung by British tenor, Russell Watson - CAF)
