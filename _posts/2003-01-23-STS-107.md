âœµ Burning Down the House by Talking Heads  &nbsp;<br />
âœ· Kung Fu Fighting by Carl Douglas.

#### Comment:
* in honor of combustion experiments on this flight
The crew had a stuffed hamster toy which played that  song. It was their 'mascot' and they took it everywhere during their training. PC

#### *Dedication:*
> *On lift-off, Space Shuttle Columbia, the first of the fleet to reach space in the 80's suffered damage to its left-wing. We would not learn that this damage was catastrophic until re-entry into the earth's atmosphere on February 1 2003. Space-shuttle Columbia suffered systemic failures throughout its descent before mission control finally lost contact with flight-commander Rick Husband and crew. Space Shuttle Columbia broke-apart over Texas in the early hours of the morning. Its crew would not return.*
