âœ§ Duke of Earl by Gene Chandler

#### Comment:
* Song was up linked in honor of Carl Walz's 20th anniversary. The song is one he performed for his wife, Pam, before they were married while he was a member of an Ohio band called The Blue Moons. This is the second time Walz has spent his anniversary in orbit.
