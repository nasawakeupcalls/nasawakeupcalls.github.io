âœ¦ Let It Snow Parody by The Prox Ops Boys

#### Comment:
* Parody set to the tune of Let It Snow - with a message to the crew in the lyrics of Bring her home meaning the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). It was a reminder that Columbia originally was to have been in orbit at Christmastime and that the astronauts had promised to bring the satellite back as a holiday gift to all those with experiments on board. Written and recorded by The Prox Ops Boys, Dave Thompson, Mark Schrock, Brian Bertrand, Steve Walker, Ted Rickerl, and Greg Schrage. From the Mission Operations Directorate's Orbit Dynamics (aka Prox Ops) Office
