âœ« Blue Sky by Big Head Todd and the Monsters

#### Comment:
* The song was performed live by Todd Park Mohr, vocalist and lead guitarist of the band, accompanied by fellow band mates Brian Nevin, Rob Squires and Jeremy Lawton. The song received the most votes in NASA's Top 40 song contest receiving 722,662 votes (29 percent of the 2,463,774 total). It was originally written as a tribute to the space program and workforce, and is routinely played in concert by the four-member band. The live performance was the first time a shuttle crew has been awakened live from Mission Control, Houston. That was terrific, Lindsey radioed down to Mohr. We really appreciate it and congratulations on winning the contest. Mohr, with his three band members in the control center, thanked Lindsey for his courage, bravery and your effort in just giving all of us a better shot at knowing more. It's very inspirational to the arts as well.
