‚äπ Theme from F-Troop by UNKNOWN

#### Comment:
* The significance of that being referring to this crew as the F-crew for the purposes of training documents the crews have been listed alphabetically. A-crew was the STS-I crew -John Young,Bob Crippen. B-crew was the STS-2 crew - Dick Truly and Joe Engle. Of course, now up to STS-6. This is the F-crew and in a jocular vein they refer to themselves not as the F-crew but the F-Troop and accordingly the significance of this mornings wake up call. From STS-6 AIR/GROUND TRANSCRIPT
